# Imitate Bot
This bot utilizes [this] (https://github.com/esdalmaijer/markovbot) MarkovBot code and the [Twitter API] (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) to create a TwitterBot that is capable of "imitating" any Twitter user with the Markov text analysis of that user's tweets. The bot reads tweets with [this get_all_tweets method] (https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496). 

A future update to this bot will allow the bot to imitate a user as long as the mention has a valid handle in it, rather than requiring the "@imitatebot string @handle..." format.
